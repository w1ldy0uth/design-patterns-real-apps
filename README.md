Have you ever wondered 'why do I need this goofy design pattern if they're only covering abstract cases'? Sure you do.

You're gonna understand how many basic concepts of projramming languages and frameworks are already using design patterns, how you can reinvent some popular tools using patterns and how you can apply them to your real project.
